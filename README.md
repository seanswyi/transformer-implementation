### To-Do.

- [ ] Fix code so that weights are shared among input, output embeddings and pre-softmax linear layer.
- [x] ~~Implement data parallelism to speed up process.~~ (Dec. 1st, 2020)
- [x] ~~Implement BLEU score.~~ (Dec. 1st, 2020)
- [x] ~~Implement evaluation code.~~ (Dec. 1st, 2020)
- [ ] Visualize results using [W&B](https://www.wandb.com/) or another tool.
